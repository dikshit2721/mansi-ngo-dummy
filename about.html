            We work in close coordination with government agencies at various levels – National, State and District – to run child welfare projects. We work with the aim to support and contribute towards Government of India’s vision to build a “Bharat” where children are well-nurtured, with full opportunities for growth and development in a safe and protective environment.<br>
            
            We urge you to play your part in gifting a meaningful childhood to underprivileged children. Through your contributions, we can reach more children and support their various needs.<br>
